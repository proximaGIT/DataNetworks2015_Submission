csma-aloha.modest
  This file models the CSMA protocol with ALOHA back off scheme. When a 
  collision is detected, after the transmission ends (1 time unit), it waits 
  for 1 time unit and then try to retransmit with probability P or wait for 
  another 1 time unit with probability (1-P). And because it is CSMA, it always
  listen to the medium and wait until it is idle before transmitting (or 
  retransmitting).
csma-beb.modest
  This file models the CSMA protocol with binary exponential back off scheme.
  It is similar to csma-aloha.modest. The difference is that instead of wait 
  for 1 time unit, it wait for K time unit when a collision happen. K is chosen 
  randomly from  {0, 1, ..., (2^m)-1} and m is the number of collision that the 
  current transmission have experienced. After it waited for K time unit, it
  retransmit the transmission.
csmacd-aloha.modest
  This file models the CSMA/CD protocol with ALOHA back off scheme. It is very
  similar to csma-aloha.modest. The only difference is that failed transmission
  is stopped immediately when the collision is detected without waiting for the
  data to be fully transmitted. 
csmacd-BEB.modest
  This file models the CSMA/CD protocol with binary exponential back off scheme. 
  It is very similar to csma-beb.modest. The only difference is that failed 
  transmission is stopped immediately when the collision is detected without
  waiting for the data to be fully transmitted.
